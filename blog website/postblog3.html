        <h2 class="sub-heading">Vape Device Buying Guide FAQs</h2>
        <p class="post-text">As you take your first steps into vaping, it can be difficult to know what’s right for you. There are several different types of vape devices that are designed with a variety of functions in mind. So, to help you find the best vape device for you, this guide outlines the different types of vape devices, as well as what they do and how they work.
        First, we answer a few frequently asked questions relating to vaping...</p>
        <h2 class="sub-heading">How does vaping work?</h2>
        <p class="post-text">Vaping is the act of inhaling vapor created by a vape device. Vaping is non-combustible, so is considered a cleaner alternative to smoking as it doesn’t involve the same chemicals and tar associated with burning tobacco.</p>
        <h2 class="sub-heading">What are the different styles of vaping?</h2>
        <p class="post-text">Mouth-to-lung (MTL) and direct-to-lung (DTL) are the two styles of vaping.</p>
        <p class="post-text">MTL vaping is known as the ‘classic’ style of vaping and is similar to smoking a cigarette, where the vapor is held in the mouth before being inhaled into the lungs. Most vapers, especially those who are new to vaping, prefer MTL vaping as it contains more nicotine and a stronger throat hit than DTL vaping. MTL vaping is most closely associated with plus-ohm vaping, as it best replicates the experience of smoking a cigarette.</p>
        <h2 class="sub-heading">Direct-to-lung (DTL) vaping</h2>
        <p class="post-text">DTL is where the vapor is inhaled directly into the lungs, which is more like taking a breath. It’s more popular with those who like to create larger clouds of vapor and want a smoother throat hit. DTL is a less intense experience than MTL vaping and is achieved with sub-ohm vaping, where more air passes over the coils – resulting in warmer, bigger vapor.</p>
        <h2 class="sub-heading">What is sub-ohm vaping?</h2>
        <p class="post-text">When you explore DropAndCloud.com for your new vape device, you may come across the term ‘sub-ohm’. This term defines vaping coils with a resistance level less than 1.0 ohm, e.g. 0.8ohms.
            Sub-ohm vaping allows the coil to get hotter, which results in a warmer vapor, drier hit, and larger clouds. Just remember that sub-ohm vaping uses more of your cell, so ensure your device is fully charged or carries a spare cell.
            Explore our wide range of sub-ohm box mod kits, including the fast-charging Voopoo Drag 3 177w Kit and the hugely popular SMOK Scar-18 230w Kit.</p>
        <h2 class="sub-heading">What is plus-ohm vaping?</h2>
        <p class="post-text">Plus-ohm relates to coils with a resistance of above 1.0 ohms. Many vape devices are now plus-ohm and use coils with resistance between 1.0 and 3.0ohms.

            Plus-ohm coils are ideal for MTL vaping and produce less vapor than sub-ohm vaping.
            
            If you’re looking for a plus-ohm experience, the Vaporesso Xros Mini is a pure MTL pod vape that comes with a 1.2ohm pod to get you started.</p>
        <h2 class="sub-heading">What types of vape devices are available?</h2>
        <p class="post-text">DropAndCloud.com offers a wide range of vape devices, including MTL and DTL vaping devices, as well as disposable vapes and advanced box mod kits.</p>
        <h2 class="sub-heading">Disposable vapes</h2>
        <p class="post-text">Disposable vape devices come pre-filled and pre-charged with vape juice. They are designed for MTL vaping and aim to imitate the experience of smoking a cigarette.

            These devices, like the Vaptio Beco Mesh Disposable, are a convenient way for people to assess whether vaping is for them before committing to a reusable device.</p>
        <h2 class="sub-heading">Vape pens</h2>
        <p class="post-text">Vape pens are small but powerful devices that are typically refillable and rechargeable. They’re an effective way to transition into vaping as they’re commonly made for MTL vaping. These devices are easy to use and deliver a satisfying amount of vapor to help combat cravings.</p>
        <h2 class="sub-heading">Pod systems</h2>
        <p class="post-text">Pod systems are easy to use and extremely convenient thanks to their size and long cell life. Despite their small size, pod systems can still offer a highly satisfying vape thanks to nic salts, which are less distilled than E-liquids and absorbed more quickly.

            Pod systems are normally made for MTL vaping; however, pod mods that support both MTL & DTL vaping are available too.</p>
        <h2 class="sub-heading">Box mod kits</h2>
        <p class="post-text">The largest and most advanced device available, box mods are often favored by experienced vapers. They can be easily customized to the user’s preference and have a much larger cell than the other devices.

            While Box Mod Kits occasionally support MTL vaping, they’re more commonly used for DTL vaping.</p>
